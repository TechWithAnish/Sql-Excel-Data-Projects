Fuel Price Analysis in Indian States
This project analyzes two decades of petrol and diesel prices across Indian states to identify trends, regional variations, and key inflationary factors. 
Using historical data, the analysis uncovers the impact of global crude prices, currency fluctuations, and government taxes on fuel prices. 
The project offers policymakers and economists actionable insights, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can inform strategic decisions in the energy sector.
